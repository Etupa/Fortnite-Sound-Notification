PowerShell script is set up to monitor log file from the Epic Game Launcher so it plays a sound whenever a new game invite is detected.

FIRST YOU HAVE TO ENABLE LOG FILE FORM EPIC LAUNCHER 

Epic Games Launcher Logs

To generate Epic Games Launcher logs:

    Open the Epic Games Launcher
    In the upper right corner click the Account Icon
    Typically this icon is the first letter of your username
    Select Settings
    check the Enable Debug Logging box
    A pop-up will appear
    Click the Enable Now button

Then simply run the script 

- Right click the PS1 and run with powershell. Hit anykey to exit and clean temp files.

- Alternatively you can create a Shortcut for double clicking instead of right clic > Run With PowerShell :   
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Path\To\Your\script.ps1"

- Or use PS2EXE to create an .EXE (will need to be whitelisted in your AV).
