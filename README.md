# Fortnite-Sound-Notification

PowerShell script is set up to monitor log file from the Epic Game Launcher so it plays a sound whenever a new game invite is detected.

Right click the PS1 and run with powershell. Hit anykey to exit and clean temp files.

Alternatively you can create a Shortcut for double clicking instead of right clic > Run With PowerShell :   
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Path\To\Your\script.ps1"

Or use PS2EXE to create an .EXE (will need to be whitelisted in your AV).
